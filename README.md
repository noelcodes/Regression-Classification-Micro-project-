# Regression & Classification (Micro-project)
Mini school project: Prediction of Housing Prices (regression) and Decision to buy/not (classification)
NoelTam_DSI3_project-3 - This is version 1, after introduction of regression and classification modelling.
Noel_DSI3_Project3_ver2 - Version 2, I re-attempt this project after learning more regression and classification modeling technique.

### Instructions
You have just joined a new "full stack" real estate company in Ames, Iowa. The strategy of the firm is two-fold:

Own the entire process from the purchase of the land all the way to sale of the house, and anything in between.
Use statistical analysis to optimize investment and maximize return.
The company is still small, and though investment is substantial the short-term goals of the company are more oriented towards purchasing existing houses and flipping them as opposed to constructing entirely new houses. That being said, the company has access to a large construction workforce operating at rock-bottom prices.

This project uses the Ames housing data recently made available on kaggle.
